# Hello or Dzięń dobry 👋

I'm Zina, a QA Engineer with a passion for learning and growing in tech 👩‍💻 \
I have a year of experience in manual software tesing and have worked on several projects, testing various web and desktop applications \
🇵🇱 Based in Wroclaw, Poland \
🌱 I’m currently learning Automated Testing on JavaScript \
💡 I love to keep learning and trying out new things, that's why I have a variety of projects on my page \
🎨 When I'm not testing, you can find me painting — unwinding and destressing after a long day
